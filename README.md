============

These are my configuration files for my arch setup.
I use [themer](/S0lll0s/themer) to manage my themes, you will need to use `themer render all` and `themer activate [sometheme]` to get the configs in the right place.

This repo is intended to be placed at `~`, though I recommend you just clone it somewhere and copy what you like to `~`.
